    <p>The ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic computer built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 by John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) included operational characteristics, memory, and arithmetic. It was the first computer of its time to be operational at the University of Pennsylvania. The machine was rather bulky, taking up entire walls as well as having dangling cables running across it. Despite its appearance, the ENIAC was revolutionary for its time. The ENIAC gave way to many other milestones in technology such as personal computers and the World Wide Web.It was the stepping stone and foundation for computers as we know them today. Despite it’s primitive nature by today’s standards, it’s impact is undeniable upon computer science and development. The ENIAC was a crucial step forward in the ever-advancing developments within computer science and the world of computers would be undeniably altered without the ENIAC.

    <p>In August 1981, IBM launched one of the most popular computers, the IBM PC. Despite not being the first of its kind, it set the standard for what a PC should be. The PC cost $1,565 at the time of its release in 1981. The aforementioned IBM PC, the IBM 5150, had 40k of read-only memory and 16k of user memory. It also had a built-in speaker and a, revolutionary at the time, feature to run diagnostic checks upon itself. The IBM 5150 ran on MS-DOS 1.0, a 16-bit operating system developed by Microsoft. Microsoft would release Windows 1.0 four years later in November 1985. Windows would become an operating system used by millions today. The IBM 5150 was the gateway to personal computers that would become available to the public household. Its iconic design and widespread popularity caused the 5150 to become the standard for personal computers for years to come.

    <p>Within weeks of each other in 1994, the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation revolutionized the video game industry. Sega gradually fell into irrelevance, however; Sony continued with multiple iterations and revisions of the PlayStation that still makes it a popular console today. Despite their long term successes, both consoles had large impacts and influences upon the Video Game industry. Unlike other consoles such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Mega Drive, the Saturn and PlayStation operated via disks rather than cartridges. Therefore, the Saturn and PlayStation had enough power to run games that were stunning at the time. Some of said games include “Nights into Dreams” for the Saturn and “Final Fantasy VII” for the PlayStation, a role-playing game with amazing depth for the time. The innovations made by the Saturn and PlayStation echoed throughout every subsequent console to follow them. These consoles were a demonstration that publicly available electronics can render complicated scenarios with such computational power.

    <p>
In the early 2000s, broadband internet connections were implemented all across the developed world. Slow and limited Dial Up connections have all but been abandoned in favor of the much more powerful broadband connections. Broadband caused citizens of developed countries to become accustomed to high-speed downloads, extremely quick browsing, streaming videos and other content in  much higher resolutions, and a wide variety of other connection-based innovations occurring throughout the world. According to Ofcom, a communication regulator, over 25.3 million fixed broadband connections have been established across the UK at the end of 2016 and the number of users is ever growing. Millions of people across the globe have initiated broadband connections, connecting them with others around the globe at blazing speeds. The high speed connections also allow for further innovations in the electronic world as people get more and more benefits from technology and further push the limits of what is thought to be impossible.

    <p>The standard of living in the world today is rapidly evolving to house more electronic implementations than ever before. Even older computers are being replaced with newer and more advanced technologies such as smartphones, smart TVs, virtual assistants and tablets. Thousands of tasks can be performed with the click of a button with these machines. For example, a song playing on a computer can instantaneously be transferred to a completely different room to be displayed upon a 72-inch TV with today’s standards of a high-speed, wireless connection. Humans are growing alongside the aid of technology as its constant innovations allow for a more advanced society year by year. The standard of comfort and the ease of life will forever be increased by computers. The first computers from over 50 years ago have led to the advanced, computer-driven society that we today are familiar with. The most primitive of computer technology, as seen today, have played a crucial role in the beneficial innovations for humanity. The fact of computers having a long history is undeniable, and its innovations will bring us to the impossible more and more with each passing day.
